🚀 Just Launched: My Netflix-Inspired Web Project! 🎬

I'm excited to share my latest project—a sleek, Netflix-inspired web interface! Built using HTML, CSS, and a touch of creativity, this project replicates the familiar streaming platform's design while incorporating unique tweaks of my own.

🔍 Highlights:

Responsive design for all devices 📱💻
Smooth UI transitions and animations ✨
Interactive FAQ section ❓
Custom video integration 🎥
This was a great opportunity to sharpen my front-end development skills, and I’m excited about the potential for adding more features down the line.
